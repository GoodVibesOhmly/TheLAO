# The LAO

> Moloch whose fingers are ten armies! 

~ Allen Ginsberg, Howl

## Design Principles

In developing The LAO, we realized that the more Solidity we wrote, the greater the likelihood that we would lose everyone's money. In order to prioritize security, we took simplicity and elegance as our primary design principles. We consciously skipped many features, and the result is what we believe to be a Minimally Viable LAO.
