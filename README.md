# The LAO

> The Way produces one, one produces two.

> The two produce the three and the three produce all things.

> All things submit to yin and embrace yang.

> They soften their energy to achieve harmony. 

~ Lao Tzu, Dao De Jing

## Design Principles

In designing a *Minimum Viable Venture Moloch*, we borrowed greatly from the original Moloch design that emphasizes simple Solidity scripts for voting and other member transactions, largely relying on off-chain coordination to scale membership and deliver funding to promising Ethereum ventures. In our case, we will further imbue LAO actions with legal effect through OpenLaw smart agreements and establish a proxy entity.
